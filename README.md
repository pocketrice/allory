_**A Light Lil' Obsolete Renderer, Yay!**_

Rust experiment for messing with rendering techniques old and new — N64 render matrix, surface-stable fractal dithering, KSA halftoning, SNES modes, subpixel rendering simulation, accurate CRT/vector/GBA visual emulation, Source/[TF2](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/NPAR07_IllustrativeRenderingInTeamFortress2.pdf) lighting techniques, BW/B2W2 sprite armatures, raymarching, TUI/UI animations, CIELAB/HSLuv/etc. colorspaces, and just other neat tricks while getting comfy with integrating maximally efficient yet malleable 3D graphics into software design without bloated all-purpose libraries. _Making everything a single project promotes intermixing of design takeaways and motivates the creation of a unified visualization/testing toolkit (and just a really rad collage!)_

In other words...

...studying and emulating as many rendering techniques from games and consoles spanning most of VG history all in one neat little hobby project while remaking them as efficiently as humanly possible. Here goes nothing!
