_**A Light Lil' Obsolete Renderer, Yay!**_

Rust experiment for messing with rendering techniques old and new â€” N64 render matrix, surface-stable fractal dithering, KSA halftoning, SNES modes, subpixel rendering simulation, BW/B2W2 sprite armatures, raymarching, UI animations, and other neat GLSL tricks and getting comfy with integrating maximally efficient and malleable 3D graphics into software design without bloated all-purpose libraries.

Consider this a supplement (extension? corollary?) to _tonic_ and [_snesgans_](https://github.com/pocketrice/snesgans).
