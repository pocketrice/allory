Rust experiment for messing with rendering techniques old and new.

_**Examples...!**_ N64 render matrix and [megatextures]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/16jx9yl/how_i_implemented_megatextures_on_real_nintendo/](https://youtu.be/Sf036fO-ZUk)), [surface-stable fractal dithering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPqGaIMVuLs), KSA halftoning, SNES modes, [subpixel rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering) simulation, human-friendly sprite transforms, accurate CRT/vector/GBA visual emulation, Source/[TF2](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/NPAR07_IllustrativeRenderingInTeamFortress2.pdf) lighting techniques, 3D skeuomorphic UI, PTCGP/Balatro card FX, ASCII/PETSCII rendering, audio visualizers, expressive animations á la I AM YOUR BEAST and more, [MV](https://youtu.be/bBbnxPgsIJg)-style textwork, pseudo-pixel models, [BW/B2W2 sprite armatures](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Black_and_White_sprites), raymarching, TUI/UI animations, CIELAB/[HSLuv](https://www.hsluv.org/)/etc colorspaces, and simply other neat tricks while getting comfy with integrating maximally efficient yet malleable 3D graphics into software design without bloated all-purpose libraries. _Making everything a single project promotes intermixing of design takeaways and motivates the creation of a unified visualization/testing toolkit (and just a really rad gallery!)_

In other words...

...studying and emulating as many rendering techniques from consoles spanning most of VG history as well as the broader CG field as a whole all in one neat little hobby project while remaking them as efficiently as humanly possible.
