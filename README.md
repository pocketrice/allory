_**A Light Lil' Obsolete Renderer, Yay!**_

Rust experiment for messing with rendering techniques old and new — N64 render matrix, surface-stable fractal dithering, KSA halftoning, SNES modes, subpixel rendering simulation, accurate CRT/vector/GBA visual emulation, Source/[TF2](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/NPAR07_IllustrativeRenderingInTeamFortress2.pdf) lighting techniques, 3D skeuomorphic UI, PTCGP/Balatro card FX, pseudo-pixel models, BW/B2W2 sprite armatures, raymarching, TUI/UI animations, CIELAB/HSLuv/etc. colorspaces, and just other neat tricks while getting comfy with integrating maximally efficient yet malleable 3D graphics into software design without bloated all-purpose libraries. _Making everything a single project promotes intermixing of design takeaways and motivates the creation of a unified visualization/testing toolkit (and just a really rad scrapbook!)_

In other words...

...studying and emulating as many rendering techniques from consoles spanning most of VG history as well as the broader CG field as a whole all in one neat little hobby project while remaking them as efficiently as humanly possible.
